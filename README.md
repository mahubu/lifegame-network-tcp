# lifegame-network-tcp
A simple life game over TCP network.

## Motivation
Learn low-level TCP sockets in C++ by creating a minimal network engine. Inspired by [Bousk](https://bousk.developpez.com/cours/reseau-c++/) course. Thanks to him/her! 

### What should I do with this?
Have a look at it? Don't use it into a real product!
